# DrugSmart_Pharmacy_App
As Covid-19 spreaded globally in March, 2019, pharmacies in Ontario faced a challenge that is unheard of, that is the inability to 
communicate with its patients due to the shutdown.                                                                                  
In the summer of social distancing, I was offered by my previous employer an opportunity to build an iOS application for a local 
pharmacy that allows the following functions:                                                                                              
1. Book and manage urgent appointments: With Google Cloud Firestore, the app allows patients to send appointment requests, and pharmacy 
owners can make the decision to either approve or decline the appointment request depending on the urgency.                             
2. Display past and future appointments: With UITableView and Google Cloud Firestore, patients and owners can see clearly all the 
booked appointments on a table ordered by date. 
3. Send new prescription: With SMTP email server, patients can send their prescription information to the pharmacy owners without 
turning on their email app on their phones.                                                                                             
4. Retail non-prescription products: With Google Firestore Storage and Swift URLSessions, pharmacy owners can upload images and decriptions of their products on an e-commerce platform.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                
The majority of the backend code has been completed, what's left to do include showcasing the products to patients, connect Stripe API,
and design a UI that fits the theme. This is my first time programming with Swift and it has been a challenge learning the Firebase API 
and configure the code to the model-view-controller design pattern. I will be updating this git constantly and hope to soon submit this 
project to Apple Store once everything is finished.
